# E.L.O. proof of concept - aka "assistant"

## Objective

ELO = Enhanced Logical Operative
To create an environment control plane entity powered by AI.

## Scope

This project is meant to be POC work. "Garage time", if you will.

No R.A.G. for this project, however MoE may be explored.

## Inspiration

Tony Stark, J.A.R.V.I.S. and Robert Elo Bishop(my grandfather). ELO is meant to be more than an assistant. If you think of Operating Systems working on computers, think of ELO as an *operative*. Another way to define the concept is a Semi-Autonomous AI powered operative working on your behalf. Outfit with integrations, standard library of defined functions, local access, and intuitive interfacing.

## Desired state

"Assistant (this folder) is meant to be the POC for ELO. In this I'd like to accomplish or deliver on this basic feature set:

- A support window for ELO to show/render result sets from queries
- A control window where ELO will display chat, diagnostics, etc.
- Chat GPT integration or Local LLM generation; The option to choose/switch models.
- Internet Search (whitelisted sources)
- Wake and shut down word/phrases/intents

## tech stack/integrations

Python- language
Poetry- build system
pyttsx4/Elevel labs- Text to speech
OpenAI API- interact with models
