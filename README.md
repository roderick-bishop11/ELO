# ELO = Enhanced Logic Operative

## Objective

To create an environment control plane entity powered by AI.

## Overview

Inspired by virtual assistants and Super-Inteligences from movies and pop culture like J.A.R.V.I.S., Zarbon, Hal 9000 and Samantha, ELO (Enhanced Logic Operative), is a personal project meant to make an E.L.O. a reality for me. With the intent to build something that is deployable, personalizable, and provides intuitive & useful interfacing with LLM's.

For a cool definition, ELO is an environment control plane entity powered by AI.

This project has 3 parts:

*Please look into each individual folder for more in-depth documentation & overview.*

- [assistant](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/ELO/tree/main/assistant): the AI powered assistant
- [ui](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/ELO/tree/main/ui): the desktop UI for this application
- [v1 enclosure](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/ELO/tree/main/enclosure): the project detailing the physical enclosure of the ELO protoype

As a younger SWE I want to work on a few projects at home using open source tooling & frameworks but with enterprise-level components so that I can work on skills like:

- Systems Arch & Design; designing systems that work, scale, and accomplish the requirements.
- TDD; Writing tests that verify function, safety, and integration
- DevOps; managing infrastructure & data across versions, applications, & environments.
- Python Programming; Giving this a try. Who knows, it might make me a pythonista!

## Scope

Say it with me... "THIS IS A 'GARAGE TIME' PROJECT"! No Billion-Dollar Unicorn startups here. Completion is not imperative, perfection is discouraged, and knowledge as well as experience are the only ends sought.

## to do

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml for pipeline to build this bad boy
- [x] Readme's
- [ ] Design Docs for Project components
- [ ] Feature sets for all project components
- [x] module separation
- [ ] startup/config function for assistant
- [ ] What does the SDLC look like for this project
- [ ] delivery spec -> when it's delivered v1, how will it be delieverd?
  - `python main.py`
  - executable?
