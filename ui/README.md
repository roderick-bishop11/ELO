# ELO UI

This is the readme for the ui folder of this project. 

## Desire State- Feature set

In this project I'd like to build:

- A support window for ELO to show/render result sets from queries
- A control window where ELO will display chat, diagnostics, etc.

## Possible tech stack/modules/tools to use

- [Slint](https://slint.dev/) or [tKinter]() or [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) -Desktop UI for python if running as python file deployed on desktop.

- JavaScript using [React](https://react.dev/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Vue](https://nextjs.org/)- UI if running as a web application. <- might be most versatile to accommodate more backend([assistant](https://github.com/roderick-bishop11/ELO/tree/main/assistant)) feature sets.

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) basic jobs to run pre-commit for automated checks & verification.

## To do

- [ ] wireframes
- Jobs for CI
  - lint
  - run tests
- Dockerfile/compose for UI deployment.
- Ephemeral? <- Would be pretty cool.
